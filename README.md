# Problem: when chained more than one animation keyframe to single element Other keyframe animations don't work second time. Can you solve it?
          for example -->
          
          LINE 29 : animation: movement 1s linear infinite , scare 1s 3s linear infinite , run 2s 4s linear infinite ;
          next time only run animation work but scare and movement doesn't
          
          LINE 22 : animation: spiderwalk 4s linear infinite, webRotate 2s 4s infinite;
          second time : only webRotate work not the spiderwalk.
          
          last animation are working in animation chain but why not the previous animations ( movement, scare, spiderwalk ) doesn't happen second time. Can you solve it? I will write you as contributor who solved this problem.
